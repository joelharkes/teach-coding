# Coding

This repository contains results of teaching code to my children.

My plan of atack:

1. teach variables, explain they are boxes to hold values
2. Learn numbers, strings and booleans
3. Learn about about arrays
5. Learn about functions.
4. Learn about objects.


Do this while building a simple game using stdin and stdout.

If interested followup can be to teach more complex type system or more about in and output (stdin,stdout,http,html,etc).
